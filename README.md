# ABA security and audit portfolio

The following is a public profile of my career as a blockchain Security Researcher and Smart Contract Auditor. I started by doing competitive audits at [Code4rena](https://code4rena.com/), [Sherlock](https://www.sherlock.xyz/) and on the newer platforms such as [CodeHawks](https://www.codehawks.com/) and [Cantina](https://cantina.xyz/).

Currently I do private audits and engagements. I also engage in collaborative security reviews with  [Guardian Audits](https://twitter.com/GuardianAudits), reputable leaders in the space in both audit quality and educational content.

You can find me on Twitter [ABA (@abarbatei)](https://twitter.com/abarbatei) or on WarpCast [ABA (abarbatei.eth)](https://warpcast.com/abarbatei.eth).
