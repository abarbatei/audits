# ABA security and audit portfolio

The following is a public profile of my journey as a blockchain Security Researcher and Smart Contract Auditor. I started by doing competitive audits at [Code4rena](https://code4rena.com/), [Sherlock](https://www.sherlock.xyz/), [CodeHawks](https://www.codehawks.com/) and now [Cantina](https://cantina.xyz/).

Now, I also do private audits and engagements. You can find me on Twitter [ABA (@abarbatei)](https://twitter.com/abarbatei) or on WarpCast [ABA (abarbatei.eth)](https://warpcast.com/abarbatei.eth). I also engage in collaborative security reviews with reputable leaders in the space, such as [Guardian Audits](https://twitter.com/GuardianAudits).
